# Auto_ValidateEmailAddresses
Curl and perl to validate if an email address is valid or not - idea to be impletemented.


The idea is to validate if the given email address is valid or not automatically without manual intervention.

let's say I have 100 email addresses and I want to register them thru Zoom, but before that I want to see if the email addresses are good or not.
( Don't want to find out that they are incorrect/invalid or with wrong information after the zoom invites are sent )

So, go to auto email verification portal and enter the email address - It will check and revert if it's good.
Now, do the same with curl by passing in the email address and get the results back in HTML.
Parse it and it shoudl say valid or not.
